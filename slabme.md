# Slab
Let's see how easy this is.

Understandably, it's a one way deal.

You can:

- Sync any number of repos from an org-account, so long as you have admin permissions
- See updates appear pretty much as soon as you commit
- And sort your GitHub-hosted content into topics along with your Slab content

But:

- You can't edit them in Slab: it kicks you back to GitHub for that
- You can't sync Slab authored/edited content to GitHub

It's definitely an advantage over some of the competitors, but not quite at Gitbook's full two-way sync. Then again, Gitbook has its own issues.
